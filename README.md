# SILKWORM_GROWTH_MONITORING_SYSTEM-IOT-MINOR_PROJECT
A monitoring system for silkworm growth incorporates sensors for monitoring temperature,
humidity, and air quality, with data analysis facilitated through a mobile application (APK) and
Firebase. This setup enables users to receive timely alerts regarding any potential issues and
grants remote accessibility, possibly integrating with environmental control systems. By offering
real-time insights into silkworm development, it enhances management practices and contributes
to improved silk production.

## Features
- The objective of a silkworm growth monitoring system is multifaceted, encompassing various
aspects essential for successful cultivation and silk production.
- The system aims to optimize environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity,
and light, along with ensuring the quality and availability of mulberry leaves or artificial diet,
the primary food source for silkworms.
- Continuous monitoring and adjustment of these parameters create an environment
conducive to healthy growth and development throughout the silkworm life cycle.
